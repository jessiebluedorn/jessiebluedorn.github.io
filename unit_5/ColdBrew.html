<h1 class="sub">Have a Cold Brew Coffee in NYC</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Birch</li>
		<p>21 E 27th St, New York, NY 10016</p>
		<p>I love how spacious this location is-- it's much larger than some of their other mahattan spots.</p>
		<br>
	<li>Ludlow Coffee Supply</li>
		<p>176 Ludlow St, New York, NY 10002</p>
		<p>A fun hipster choice in the LES, this coffee shop is located right next to the Ludlow Hotel and actually has a working barbershop in the back. I'm a big fan of their plants.</p>
		<br>
	<li>Perk Kafe</li>
		<p>162 E 37th St, New York, NY 10016</p>
		<p>Perk is best described as cozy, which is a nice change of pace from some of the very trendy options on this list.</p>
		<br>
	<li>Stumptown Coffee Roasters</li>
		<p>Ace Hotel New York, 18 W 29th St, New York, NY 10001</p>
		<p>Located in the lobby of the Ace Hotel, Stumptown is a great choice if you want to post up in the Ace Lobby (which doubles as a communal workspace) and fire off some eamails.</p>
